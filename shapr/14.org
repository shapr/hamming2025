# notes for chapter 14 of Hamming on Hamming

#+begin_quote
People would not convert to oscilloscopes

What came before?

Hamming saw these non-converts as a social loss, and decided to do something about it *right then*.

My lesson learned: train yourself and train your coworkers.
Try new things and write about the trade-offs encountered.

(for example, [[https://jj-vcs.github.io/][jujutsu]] being so much easier to teach than git)

Hamming decided digital logic was the future, and set out to convince an expert to write about that.
He instead ended up writing the book himself, because the expert was too busy researching.
One lesson I see is that writing about your research is as important as the research itself.
It's no good if you find something awesome but no else learns that!

Doing what needed to be done,
though I did not want to do it,
paid off handsomely in the long term!

There's a great lesson for me!

Any /complete set of functions/ will do about as well as any other for representing
arbitrary functions.

What? Where do I read about this?!
