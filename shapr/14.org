# notes for chapter 14 of Hamming on Hamming

#+begin_quote
People would not convert to oscilloscopes
#+end_quote
What came before?

Hamming saw these non-converts as a social loss, and decided to do something about it *right then*.

My lesson learned: train yourself and train your coworkers.
Try new things and write about the trade-offs encountered.

(for example, [[https://jj-vcs.github.io/][jujutsu]] being so much easier to teach than git)

Hamming decided digital logic was the future, and set out to convince an expert to write about that.
He instead ended up writing the book himself, because the expert was too busy researching.
One lesson I see is that writing about your research is as important as the research itself.
It's no good if you find something awesome but no else learns that!

Doing what needed to be done,
though I did not want to do it,
paid off handsomely in the long term!
#+end_quote
There's a great lesson for me!

#+begin_quote
Any /complete set of functions/ will do about as well as any other for representing
arbitrary functions.
#+end_quote
What? Where do I read about this?!

Ok, but even so, Hamming points out that if that's true, why are we using the Fourier series?

He says we're using time invariant because there's no natural origin of time.
Trig functions are "the eigenfunctions of translation in both Fourier series and Fourier integrals" ðŸ¤”
Yet again, I wish I knew more basic math. Maybe I can bribe a friend to teach me? (yes, but motivationally expensive)

#+begin_quote
[...] /linear systems/ have the same eigenfunctions -- the complex exponentials which are equivalent to the real trigonometric functions
#+end_quote

but also Nyquist's Theorem

#+begin_quote
the famous /transfer function/ is exactly the eigenvalues of the corresponding eigenfunctions
#+end_quote

Yeah, I gotta spend more time doing math ðŸ˜¢

I like Hamming's story about using aliasing to sample high frequencies.
Can I record high frequency sound on my computer and play it back lower with this trick? How would I do this?

- [ ] what are ~complex exponentials~ ?
- [ ] what are eigenvectors and eigenfunctions?
  - [ ] read about linear algebra, keith says it's in there
- [ ] Nyquist sampling - twice the highest frequency you want to sample
  - [ ] what was that "get around nyquist" trick I heard about at the HSV makerspace?

A digital filter is like a moving window on top of the data.
That window is used to calculate the changed output signal.
