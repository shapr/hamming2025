# notes for chapter 25 of Hamming on Hamming

Creativity!

I think creativity / originality is being able to transfer knowledge / understanding / patterns of thought from one area to another.

If you want to do something no one has ever done before, shuffle a
deck of cards. All possible decks are 52 factorial, it's likely you'll
end up one that hasn't existed in physical cards.

creativity, should include /value/ ? but to whom?

(I suggest reading [[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL38791133M/Art_and_Fear][Art and Fear]] to clarify your own thoughts here)

This next section about genetics and continental drift suggests originality and novelty aren't appreciated until they're applied to do something of value to humans?

Creativity seems, among other things, to be “usefully” putting
together things which were not perceived to be related before

Yeah, that!

Hamming says individual creativity can be improved, but says he has no real suggestions.

I disagree, isn't this whole book demonstrating how he applied his own creativity?
Seems like he's saying, prepare your mind by learning a bunch, then deeply understand a problem, then try to think up ways to make things easier/better, and don't settle for your first result?

1. recognize the problem
2. refine the problem - don't hurry with this
   Hamming says this "requires /emotional involvement/ ", but I'm not convinced.
   1. optionally, drop the problem for sometime
3. insight! idea might be flawed, but could be refined? optionally return to step 2 or 2a

Aha, one of my favorite bits of wisdom from this book!
This approach has solved many problems for me:
#+begin_quote
When stuck I often ask myself, “If I had a solution, what would it
look like?”
#+end_quote

Yet again, "Luck favors the prepared mind".

Get down to the fundamentals!

#+begin_quote
In the past I have deliberately managed myself in this matter by
promising a result by a given date, and then, like a cornered rat,
having at the last minute to find something! I have been surprised at
how often this simple trick of managing myself has worked for me.
#+end_quote

This has failed for me rather often. Working directly with someone
else on a project, that always works for me!

You must change yourself to be more creative!

#+begin_quote
We are, in a very real sense, the sum total of our habits, and nothing
more; hence by changing our habits, once we understand which ones we
should change and in what directions and understand our limitations in
changing ourselves, then we are on the path along which we want to go.
#+end_quote

This I agree with strongly, it also matches [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does][The purpose of a system is what it does]].

Don't get stuck on a problem!
