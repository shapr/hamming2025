# notes for chapter 4 of Hamming on Hamming

When can we fit a lifetime of unique music in a pocket? Will that kill streaming services?
If you have all the music with you, then curation becomes the bottleneck? You find random cool things and send a link to your friends?

When can we fit a lifetime of video in a pocket?

When can we fit an entire recording of our lifetime in our pocket?

Were the von Neumann reports published? I'd like to read them.

Spaghetti code started with error correcting programs that were written with absolute binary addresses!

Hamming had a girl who did his programming. She tried symbolic
assembly programming and it was a big time saver. She later tried
FORTRAN and it was even better! Even so, almost nobody else used these
tools!

Almost all professionals are slow to use their own expertise for their own work.

I feel so seen.

Consider how in the future, when you are a great expert, you will avoid this error.

I will EXPLORE HARDER! I will try to AUTOMATE MY LIFE!

- try BQN (APL)
- find a local calendar system that will let me fire scripts at a certain time before an event.

Switching to FORTRAN meant Hamming and his programmer could produce ten times as much as others were doing.
#+begin_quote
But to them, programming in FORTRAN was not for real programmers!

#+begin_quote
To see the obvious often takes an outsider or else someone like me who is *thoughtful and wonders what he is doing and why it is all necessary*.
#+end_quote

Think outside the local problem! THINK BIG!

On to virtual machines !

Maybe WASM is the first decent virtual machine? The JVM was ok. Wait, x86 is now a virtual machine too! It's not the real hardware underneath, it's the spec that the underneath hardware implements!
#+begin_quote
Computers are actually *symbol manipulators*.
