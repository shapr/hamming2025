# notes for chapter 28 of Hamming on Hamming

Systems Engineering

Instructors may says "I'm teaching students calculus" but the real goal is:
#+begin_quote
I am going to educate the students and prepare them for their future careers.
#+end_quote

What's your system? I mean YOU! What's the global goal of you, the system?

#+begin_quote
Systems engineering is the attempt to keep at all times the larger goals in mind and to translate local
actions into global results. /But there is no single larger picture./
#+end_quote

This is a hard idea to integrate. I don't have enough context to do global optimization!

#+begin_quote
If you optimize the components you will probably ruin the system performance.
#+end_quote
I don't know how to apply this to my daily work, but it seems important?

Hamming uses this to say "Testing a student at the end of each course is local optimization" and thus does not *educate* the student!
He points to many specifics that are skipped until they become relevant, like complex numbers.

Hamming's second rule of systems engineering:
#+begin_quote
Part of systems engineering design is to prepare for changes so they
can be gracefully made and still not degrade the other parts.
#+end_quote
I'm gonna say that's where gnu autotools will be surprisingly useful in the future.
That is, there will be a breaking change at some point, and autotools will be easily updated to handle that, but other software in that role will not.

Rule 3:
#+begin_quote
The closer you meet specifications the worse the performance will be when overloaded.
#+end_quote
And a bit later
#+begin_quote
Hence good design generally includes the graceful decay of performance
when the specifications are exceeded.
#+end_quote
Maybe that's why Ethernet beat out Token Ring? ðŸ¤”

Oh hey, I bought this book [[https://us.artechhouse.com/Systems-Engineering-Principles-and-Practice-P2022.aspx][One Man's Systems Engineering]] but I still haven't read it!

Hammings makes several references to Westerman's writings, gotta read that!

#+begin_quote
I said it before, but let me say it again, a solution which does not
provide greater insight than you had when you began is a poor solution
indeed, but it may be all that you can do given the time constraints
of the situation.
#+end_quote
Yeah, I've built these :-(
