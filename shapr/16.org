# notes for chapter 16 of Hamming on Hamming

Hamming almost came up with the FFT.

He says he didn't because it wouldn't work on the first computer he tried it on, and he didn't think to revisit it later on a computer where it would work.

When you say something is not possible, do not say it again at a later date unless you review *why* it was impossible.

This is why I enjoy working with junior devs, my ancient learning about what was impossible gets active questioning!

- power spectra :: the frequencies of the input and output?

These were used by Bohr to understand how atoms are structured?
Wait what? This sounds like an amazing tool, and it's related to digital filters?
I think it's this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density

Oh hey, white noise means "mostly in the lower frequencies" ?!

This chapter is connecting a bunch of things I've thought about shallowly. I could stand to re-read this a few times and pick up the background.

Hamming talks about removing parts of the data for statistical reasons, that no one understands? Is that still done? Has that changed?

Ok, I'm convinced that digital filters are one specific instance of a bigger better tool, but I don't know much beyond "go learn linear algebra".
