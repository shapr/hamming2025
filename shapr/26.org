# notes for chapter 26 of Hamming on Hamming

Experts

Age is a handicap for solving problems. Start early! Solve often!

Students accept problems with implicit assumptions, limiting their ability to solve them.

Sounds like Hamming says the implicit assumptions define the paradigm of the field at the time.

Big improvements to a field of research rarely come from within that field.

If/when you become the expert, try not to stifle innovation!
