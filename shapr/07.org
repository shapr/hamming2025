# notes for chapter 7 of Hamming on Hamming

AI is the intellectual equivalent of robots? ðŸ¤” That's a pretty cool idea.

But I'd call that IA, intelligence augmentation.

From the IA viewpoint, I want proof assistants and that kind of thing.
That is, I want tools that amplify me.

Would that me crutches for my brain? I guess anything that helps me go faster and still be correct? I like strong type systems for that.

I'm fine with brute force explorations looking for solutions, but would prefer IA that exposes insight that I can use.
I want a feedback loop between me and my IA assistants, where we boost each other via shared insight.

Hamming suggests that human thinking may only appear when the underlying machine is "large enough". I guess that's like sound waves requiring sufficient density of gas molecules?

Hm, can I show I have originality? [[https://github.com/shapr/markovkeyboard/][Yes]], but maybe not more than once?

Yes, and I still prefer live music. Perhaps because of infrasound? Even my expensive speakers just aren't as good as hearing a cello in person. Maybe I'll get old enough to lose that resolution?

While it's true human performances are imperfect, each performance is a new attempt at producing what they imagine.
When I collect multiple live performances of the same song, I am chasing a higher resolution view of the evolving dream of the creator/performer.

Music listening as theory building? ðŸ˜ƒ

Oh look, Hamming also wants to see what humans and computers can do in cooperation rather than competition! I believe that's the best future for AI, IA!

If a doctor makes a mistake, they are forgiven, because they are only human. If a machine makes a mistake, who do you sue? Obviously not Facebook or Google, that would be heresy!

Dead robots is not the same as dead humans. Hm, I don't see a connection to AI. Oh, maybe it's AI used to drive robots that do firefighting or other dangerous things?

The [chess] computers are now examining millions of board positions per second,
while humans typically examine 50 to 100 at most before making a move [...]
what the human mind does when playing chess is another matter! We really do not know!

I agree. Like I said when I went to a week long camp at MIRI, I don't think humans have much understanding of how humans think.

machine plays may be said to be "to solve the problem by volume of computations" rather than by insight
#+end_quote

Human games can be hard for computers, but I certainly couldn't draw a single frame of DOOM by hand. I don't know where this thought is going ðŸ¦¬

Logical vs psychological novelty, that makes sense to me. That's much of why I write blog posts. I'm sure what I write is known by many, but it might not be new and valuable to someone who reads my blog.

Free will is a myth, you are just a machine, but how to test that? uhhh?

/perhaps thinking should be measured by not by what you do but how you do it/
When I watch a child learning how to multiply two, say three digit numbers, then I have the feeling the child is thinking
[...]
When a computer does the same multiplication, I do not feel it is thinking at all

ok, this is EXACTLY [[https://ratfactor.com/cards/naur-vs-llms][programming as theory building]] !

This also matches what Dana Scott/Joseph Stoy say in [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262690768/denotational-semantics/][denotational semantics]] where they say roughly "a function is far too large to fit more than a tiny subset into a computer".

That is, a human can build a mental model of the 'function' of multiplication, while a computer does not.

I'm gonna say the "how you do it" is "Are you memorizing key value pairs, or are you assembling a theory / mental model and I will firmly say that a theory is more general purpose.
