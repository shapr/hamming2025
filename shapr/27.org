# notes for chapter 27 of Hamming on Hamming

Unreliable data

Hm, go fast and try to do the right thing?

*Many* times Hamming found inconsistencies in data to be
 analyzed. Even the hardware used for measuring needed to be taken
 apart and rebuilt to get consistent results.

Basic scientific data is also unreliable!
The change in constants is constantly changing?

Later he points out that new equipment is tuned until it produces
consistent low variance results, then the data is handed to a
statistician who returns low variance results.

Hamming's rule:
#+begin_quote
90% of the time the next independent measurement will fall outside the
previous 90% confidence limits!
#+end_quote

Yeah, I can dig it.

Hamming was on the Board of Directors for a computer company.
The company made a careful estimate of costs of new models.
Sales estimated they could sell 10 units at one price, 15 or 20 at other prices.
The uncertainty of sales' guesses was ignored.

Careful and thorough estimates are blended with wild ass guesses, and everyone just hopes it'll work out!

Definitions of what is being measured also changes over time.

Today's "poverty" is quite possibly more luxurious than the daily life of middle ages' Kings of England.

My solution to this is to practice my own change!

Two weeks ago I switched my trackball to my left hand, since it's been
two years since I switched to right handed trackball.

My housemate finds it almost impossible to use the trackball left
handed, and mostly uses their right hand on it anyway!

The moral of the story: only experts should design surveys, and you're probably not an expert.

A better moral is:
#+begin_quote
Small samples carefully taken are better than large samples poorly done.
