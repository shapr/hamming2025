# Chapter 2
Analog amplifiers require extreme precision when high amplification is required.
Digital repeaters aren't amplifiers at all, and thus can send a signal great distances.

Quantization!

"transmission through space is the same as transmission through time"
Yeah, makes sense to me.

Analog computers still have some advantages and use cases! (ok, but what?)

Integrated chips reduced the cost and size of each electrical connection by an amazing amount.
The size reduction also reduced the amount of time required for a signal to propagate to the next wire.
The size reduction also reduced the total heat produced, and thus the cost of cooling.

(what percentage of a laptop's power is spent cooling? desktop? Is there a curve describing the tradeoff?)

The world is moving to an information based society instead of a goods based society.

Computers allow automation of many/most things. But not exactly the same thing!
It is instead an equivalent product.
(machine produced fabric is surprisingly different from human produced fabric, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_spinning][for example]])

Automating or mechanizing a process requires you to have the
fundamentals firmly in mind when you design an equivalent.
(pets vs cattle is an example? hand-configured personal computer ->  kubernetes -> AWS lambda ? )

Science will (has?) become primarily simulation and modelling instead of physical experiments.
And yet, simulations and models cannot be perfectly accurate!

Engineering is becoming closer to Science, and vice versa

Computers allow top managers to micromanage, and prevent middle
managers from getting the experience required to become top managers.
(is this happening with LLMs and junior/senior software developers?)

Hamming points out that Russian central planning didn't go well for the people who depended on that system.
(I gotta read all of Drucker and Deming, I'm certain this is relevant to their ideas of decentralization of authority for companies.)
Hamming takes this further than I thought, he suspects that large companies will lose out to smaller companies.
He says that will happen because smaller companies have less overhead and their top management is not distant from the "people on the spot".

ðŸ¤” Ok, how do I measure this?
- [ ] measure the the range of the size of the companies that make up the GDP of the USA by year since Hamming's prediction
If Hamming is right, why are there still big companies at all?
Maybe Hamming didn't consider that large companies could afford to purchase and consume their smaller competitors?

This supports my idea that big companies purchase startups as a way to work around the big company rules against innovation and change.

Computers and entertainment? Social media and streaming audio/video have eaten entertainment.

Computers and the military? Drones and satellites, yeah?

Computers and computers? We're at the top of the S curve for increasing speed and decreasing size.
Parallel processing has become essential, though the most popular/common programming languages are bad at using multiple CPUs.
GPUs have become the only general-purpose special-purpose chips.
GPUs have changed from their massively parallel origins to parallel matrix multiplication.
Perhaps we'll see a new S curve for basing our calculations on matrix multiplication?

For that matter, the shape of the x86 computer has become the convention for general-purpose hardware.
There are still a few general/special offerings like FPGAs, but not much else!
