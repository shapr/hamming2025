# Chapter 2
Analog amplifiers require extreme precision when high amplification is required.
Digital repeaters aren't amplifiers at all, and thus can send a signal great distances.

Quantization!

"transmission through space is the same as transmission through time"
Yeah, makes sense to me.

Analog computers still have some advantages and use cases! (ok, but what?)

Integrated chips reduced the cost and size of each electrical connection by an amazing amount.
The size reduction also reduced the amount of time required for a signal to propagate to the next wire.
The size reduction also reduced the total heat produced, and thus the cost of cooling.

(what percentage of a laptop's power is spent cooling? desktop? Is there a curve describing the tradeoff?)

The world is moving to an information based society instead of a goods based society.

Computers allow automation of many/most things. But not exactly the same thing!
It is instead an equivalent product.
(machine produced fabric is surprisingly different from human produced fabric, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_spinning][for example]])

Automating or mechanizing a process requires you to have the
fundamentals firmly in mind when you design an equivalent.
(pets vs cattle is an example? hand-configured personal computer ->  kubernetes -> AWS lambda ? )

Science will (has?) become primarily simulation and modelling instead of physical experiments.
And yet, simulations and models cannot be perfectly accurate!
