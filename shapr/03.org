# notes for chapter 3 of Hamming on Hamming

Napier's bones were the first digital calculation tool, what are they?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier's_bones from 1617 !

based on "dissected multiplication tables" (insert confused emoji)

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine][difference engine]] is based on the idea that most functions can be calculated by polynomials.
Wait is that how/why [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof][zkSNARKs]] and a bunch of other cryptographic tools function? I know there's a custom polynomial created for every program? right?
I gotta finish the [[https://github.com/LeastAuthority/moonmath-manual][moon math manual]] someday.

Babbage hadn't finished creating the difference engine before he thought of a NEW and MORE POWERFUL engine!
Let this be a lesson to me, ship what you have and *then* work on the exciting new idea! Maybe Babbage needed Ritalin too?

The atomic bomb was calculated using hardware from 1935, while that feels ancient, it was only ten year old hardware!
Well, there was also some custom hardware involved, I wonder if I can find a description somewhere?

Our error was simply we thought only of the kinds of things we were
currently doing and did not think in the directions of entirely new
applications of the machines!

If the speed of light is the limitation, sounds like the goal is to produce ever smaller transistors? I've heard trinary computers gives more ops in smaller space, is that true?

Do today's computers have a diamond substrate, or some other amazing heat conductor? I wish my laptop's heat pipes dumped to a flat plate on the bottom, then I could add "external cooling" myself.

I've seen computers go from 5 volts to 2.5 volts to even less, but I don't understand how that helps?

Once a boss says "no!" it's very hard to get a different decision, so don't let them say "No!" to a proposal.

The speed of a computer doesn't matter, it's the number of *micro-nobel prizes* !

The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.
#+end_quote

Big pile of stars for that quote. Ignore tools that do not increase your insight!

#+begin_quote
Are we machines?
#+end_quote

I kinda hope not, but maybe? I like to think we have free will?
