This will have [[https://www.scannedinavian.com/about.html][my]] notes for chapter 1 of [[https://press.stripe.com/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering][The Hamming book]].

"You will get out of this course only as much as you put in"

"Education is what, when, and why to do things. Training is how to do it."

"You need to know both what to do, and how to do it."

"Knowledge has doubled every 17 years."

Hypothesis: The US political climate will likely produce a dip in knowledge production.
How to measure this? count of publications over time? education participation over time?
Is a record of "breakthroughs" so I could try measuring that over time?

Aha, back of the envelope calculations appear! Are these the same as Fermi estimations?
- [ ] train Fermi estimations
- [ ] does detail of the estimation matter?
  "Having done the calculation, you are much more likely to retain the results in your mind."
  I suspect that's true for reading about new algorithms or libraries.
  So, I will learn new patterns better if I immediately use them for something, that makes sense!
- [ ] Personal todo: try to hack new bloom filter stuff https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672219 into [[https://github.com/shapr/bloohm][bloohm]] ?


#+begin_src fundamental
  Concentrate on fundamentals, at least what /you think/ at the time are
  fundamentals, and also develop the ability to learn new fields of
  knowledge when they arise so you will not be left behind, as so many
  good engineers are in the long run.
#+end_src

I first read [[http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/668][this book]] somewhere between 2005 and 2007, and focussing on the fundamentals has paid off.
But as mentioned in the "apply what you learn" snippet earlier, you gotta have a balance between learning and doing.
What's a new field to learn? FPGA dev? ðŸ¤”

#+begin_src fundamental
  I am a veteran of learning enough to get along without at the same
  time devoting all my effort to learning new topics and thereby not
  contributing my share to the total effort of the organization.
#+end_src

#+begin_src fundamental
  In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it.

  In engineering if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it.

Become an autodidact! Teach yourself everything you can!

Human limitations have more effect than technological limitations. (support: Drone use in Ukraine?)
