# notes for chapter 29 of Hamming on Hamming

You Get What You Measure

The rating system in its earlier stages may tend to remove exactly those you want at a later stage.

I think about this often, as someone who did badly my first time in university. (1.2 GPA?)
After about fifteen years of a software career, I went back to finish my bachelor's degree.
At that point, I did not care any at all about my grades, but instead about soaking up as much learning as I possibly could.
Optimizing for learning and understanding got me on the Honor Roll, and almost got me the very highest grades, entirely by accident!

I could write a whole series of blog posts about the three years I spent getting a bachelor's degree twenty years after graduating from high school.

Although measuring is clearly bad when done poorly, there is no escape
from making measurements, rating things, people, etc. Only one person
can be the head of an organization at one time, and in the selection
there has to be a reduction to an simple scale of rating so a
comparison can be made.

:-( much sadness, but I dunno how to change this

This whole chapter is rough, managers want to look good instead of give accurate figures, so upper management just doesn't know.

This points back to Hamming's earlier description of jazz band sized companies, eight people would make it harder to misreport? I hope?
